\section{Why you should use Linux}
\begin{itemize}
\item Because it costs you nothing.
\item Because some university courses expect you to, so deal with it.
\item Because the design philosophy caters towards being a power-user of your computer.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Linux philosophy}
The idea of Linux is simple-To take the idea of UNIX, which is to have a collection of programs and modules that work cohesively together-and make a free, open and community driven operating system that can be edited and customised to your heart's content.

\section{A Brief History}

I will gloss over a brief history of the origin and etymology of Linux. For more information on this subject, there is plenty of detailed history on the internet.

\subsection{The GNU coreutils}
In 1983, a large hairy man by the name of Richard Stallman was part of a programmer hobbyist group (read: early hackers) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He had become unhappy with this new operating system that had been created at Bell Labs, called Unix, because it was closed source and had become proprietary software. He worked tirelessly to replicate the output of the Bell Labs programmers, but instead as a free, non-proprietary system which resulted in the GNU Coreutils: the main software which makes up Linux (GNU being a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"). However, the kernel he had written didn't catch on, so for now his project was unsuccessful.

\subsection{The kernel}
The linux kernel was written by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a hobby, which was a free and open-source alternative to a popular operating system at the time called MINIX. He wanted to name it Freax (Freak + Free + x), but eventually settled on Linux (Linus + x) at the advice of a friend. Once he had written the kernel, seeing the GNU project that had been written and released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL), he took that work and combined it with his kernel, forming the first incarnation of what we know today as Linux.

\section{Distributions}
The base system of Linux comes in many different distributions which contain different packages and features, written by different groups. These are referred to as distros for short, and they have a wide variety of different uses, purposes, system, features, and fanbases.
This guide will attempt to be distro-independent, however, a few of the more popular distros are listed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ubuntu
\item Debian
\item Fedora
\item Linux Mint
\item Red Hat
\item CentOS
\item Arch Linux
\item Gentoo
\end{itemize}
A quick internet search can list more and describe the pros and cons of most distributions out there. Protip: There are thousands of distos.

\subsection{Package manager and repositories}
Each distribution comes with a package manager, which handles software installed on the system, and also has a number of remote repositories from which it gets its software. For example, Ubuntu uses a package manager called aptitude (apt for short). You can type:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install firefox
\end{verbatim}
to install the Mozilla Firefox web browser. It will search the remote repositories (listed in /etc/apt/sources.list) for the required packages and instructions to install them. Then it will install the software on your computer for you. The package manager can also update and remove software, and manage your local package database. This is one of the brilliant things of the package manager: you can run a single command and you've installed new software. You can run a single command, and update all your packages, etc.

\section{The X Window System}

\subsection{Xorg server}
Because at its core, Linux is just a text-based system, it has the Xorg server to provide graphical windows. Xorg is a program that runs in the background (called a \emph{daemon}) that simply runs the windows for your display. It is a very simplistic server, with which clients communicate with to display your windows. If you're \emph{especially} hardcore, you can install a Linux system without an Xorg server, and just interact with the terminal. 

\subsection{Window manager}
A window manager is a piece of software that will change your window display and add more functionality, or allow you to customise it. It works as a client which interfaces with the Xorg server, and that's all a window manager really does-it manages windows. There are many different managers out there-some of them which work completely differently to how a window system would conventionally work on other systems.

\subsection{Desktop Environment}
A desktop environment is a fully-fledged graphical display suite that adds extra features that the Window manger can't do.  Desktop environments usually include their own Window managers among other things, and because linux is so flexible, some people usually just skip the Desktop environment and install a Window manager because they want a lightweight system. A few examples of Desktop Environments are KDE, Gnome, Unity, XFCE, etc. Note that a Linux distro is not a desktop environment or window manager. In fact, most distros can be made to look quite similar by running the same desktop environments or window managers, such as the GNOME desktop environment.

\section{The Terminal}
The terminal, also know as the Command Line, Shell, or just cold, emotionless text on a black background, gives you access to the real power and beating heart of Linux. This is what we will be focusing mostly on in this guide. Linux by default uses BASH, or Bourne-Again Shell, which is based on the shell program 'sh' from UNIX. Bash will be all of our terminal interaction. 

The terminal uses files called stdout, stdin and stderr to handle text input and output to and from programs.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{stdin} - Standard Input - All your typed text input goes into programs through here.
\item \textbf{stdout} - Standard Output - All successful program output goes to here.
\item \textbf{stderr} - Standard Error - All error messages and problem codes go to here. 
\end{itemize}
For now we'll just focus on stdin and stdout.

\subsection{Terminal commands}
Firstly you should get familiar with the man pages, which are essentially the manual, and will display help pages on almost all commands.
\begin{verbatim}
Usage: man COMMAND
\end{verbatim}
Where COMMAND is replaced with whatever command you want help on. Press 'q' to exit a manual page.

Now that you know how to use the manual, here is a list of the essential commands that you should become familiar with (and you can use the manual to learn how to use them): 
\begin{verbatim}
cd	# Change directory
ls	# Show contents of directory
echo	# Print text to the screen
cat	# Display contents of a file
nano	# Edit a file via the command line
\end{verbatim}
Some extra commands which aren't essential but are certainly helpful:
\begin{verbatim}
grep	# Search for specific text within text
pwd	# Print working (current) directory
whoami	# Display user
ps	# Display running processes
pstree # Display a tree showing running processes and processes they started
top # Display most intensive running programs
who	# Display logged on users
w	# Display logged on users
which	# Display the path to a command's binary
df	# Disk space free
du	# Disk space used
passwd	# Change user password (not to be confused with pwd)
more	# Display text one screenful at a time
less	# Display text one screenful at a time
wc	# Word/letter/byte count
id	# Display the uid, gid and groups of a user
su	# Switch user
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Shell conventions}
There are a number of little quirks that the shell has that gives it more functionality.
Piping takes the stdout of the left program and connects it (i.e. \emph{pipe}s it) into stdin of the right program with the pipe operator $|$. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
# Count number of words in helloworld.txt
cat helloworld.txt | wc -w 
\end{verbatim}
Redirection directs data in and out of files, i.e. 
\begin{verbatim}
# Redirect stdout to file
echo "Hello world" > helloworld.txt

# Redirect stdout to the end of a file
echo "world." >> hello.txt

# Redirect a file to stdin
more < helloworld.txt
\end{verbatim}

\section{File system structure}
The file system is structured as a tree that flows down from the root directory, which is simply represented as /. I've taken a listing of my root directory as an example, using the ls command:
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ ls /
bin    etc         initrd.img.old  lost+found  proc  selinux  usr
boot   fixdm       lib             media       root  srv      var
cdrom  home        lib32           mnt         run   sys      vmlinuz
dev    initrd.img  lib64           opt         sbin  tmp      vmlinuz.old
\end{verbatim}
The standard path is listed as all the directories to a file, separated by the / character.
You can also use .. to represent the folder that the current folder is in, . to represent the current directory, and \textasciitilde to represent your home directory. For example
\begin{verbatim}
# Move two folders up, then into dir1 and then dir2, then back into dir1, then back into dir2
cd /../../dir1/dir2/../dir2
# Get a listing of the current directory
ls .
# Change into your home directory
cd ~
\end{verbatim}
Linux will automatically complete a command or filename if you are part-way through typing it; all you have to do is hit the [Tab] key. Press [Tab] enough times and it will list possible suggestions based on what you currently have typed in the terminal.

\subsection{\$PATH and the environment}
Variables in the shell are defined using the \texttt{export} command, and when variables are used, they start with a \$.
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ export FOO="This is a string"
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ echo $FOO
This is a string
\end{verbatim} 
You can see a list of the set environment variables by typing \texttt{set} by itself into the terminal.

Linux uses a global terminal variable to find programs. This is the \$PATH variable and it consists of a list of file paths to search in for a specified program, in order, separated by the colon (:). For example, a listing of my path:
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
\end{verbatim}
This would mean that if I were to use the program 'ls', it would search for a binary file called 'ls' in /usr/local/sbin, then in /usr/local/bin, and so on until it found it. Then it would be executed. Because these are searched in order, if you were to prepend a directory path to the front of \$PATH with your own copy of 'ls' in it, and then run the 'ls' command, then your copy would be run instead.

This is sometimes used as an exploit by modifying the user's \$PATH variable so that a path containing malicious binaries with the same names as common commands is on the front. When the user goes to run these commands, then the malicious binaries are run instead.

\section{Users and permissions}
Every user has a user ID (uid) and a group ID (gid). Each user also has a list of groups they are a part of which give them the permissions that are assigned to those groups. You can see this by using the 'id' command:
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ id
uid=1000(cody) gid=1000(cody) groups=1000(cody),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),29(audio),
30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),109(lpadmin),119(pulse),124(sambashare)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{sudo and root}
Now for the most powerful user on Linux: The root user. Root's uid and gid are both 0.
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ id root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
\end{verbatim}
Root is essentially god: root can do anything root likes, where other users would be denied due to the lack of permissions required. Root is the first account created on a newly installed Linux distro, and it is generally encouraged that you do not use the root account unless you absolutely have to because since root can do anything, then there's no stopping you from accidentally deleting something important, for example.

This is where the 'sudo' command comes in (a.k.a "super-user do"). You can use sudo to execute commands that require elevated privileges without having to actually switch to root.

Say you want to edit the hostname file, which is the name of your computer, but, by default, you need elevated privileges to edit it. You would type:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo nano /etc/hostname
\end{verbatim}
to which it asks you for your password, and then opens nano with the extra privileges provided by sudo. There is a sudoers file which contains a list of users who can use sudo, and what privileges they get from using it.

\subsection{File permissions}
Linux inherits its file permissions system from Unix. You can use the command `ls -l' to display the permissions of a file or files:
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~/junk$ ls -l
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 cody cody    9 Apr 25 21:28 junk1
drwxrwxr-x 2 cody cody 4096 Apr 25 21:29 other_junk
\end{verbatim}
The first string consists of a sequence of letters, which represent the permissions on the file. The two names refer to the owner and group the file belongs to, respectively.

Lets take the file, junk1, as our example.
The first character is the file type. This is a `d' if the file is a directory (like other\_junk).
The next part should be read as three sets of permissions
\begin{verbatim}
-rw-rw-r--
(d)( u )( g )( o ) 
(-)(rw-)(rw-)(r--)
\end{verbatim} 
where the first set, u, refers to the permissions for the user who owns the file.
The next set, g, refers to the permissions for the group that the file belongs to.
The final set, o, refers to the permissions for any other user. 
Each set uses `rwx' to specify the permission to (r)ead, (w)rite or e(x)ecute, or - if that permission is not set.
Lets take a look at the folder other\_junk.
\begin{verbatim}
drwxrwxr-x
\end{verbatim}
This is a directory, the user has read/write/execute access, users belonging to the group of the file have read/write/execute access, and everyone else has read/execute access, but not write access.

\subsection{Changing permissions}
If you want to change a file's permissions, you can use \texttt{chmod}, meaning ``change mode". There are two ways to do this: using u/g/o and +/- r/w/x:
\begin{verbatim}
chmod o+x junk1 # Add execute permission to others
chmod og+wx junk1 # Add execute and write permissions to other and group
chmod +x junk1 # Make junk1 executable for the user
chmod g-w junk1 # Remove write permissions from junk1 for group
etc...
\end{verbatim}
or with a number that represents permissions, called a bitmask. This will set all the permissions at once for you.
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~/junk$ chmod 755 junk1
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~/junk$ ls -l
total 8
-rwxr-xr-x 1 cody cody    9 Apr 25 21:28 junk1
drwxrwxr-x 2 cody cody 4096 Apr 25 21:29 other_junk
\end{verbatim}
The bit mask is three digits (sometimes four digits) between the numbers 0 and 7. Each digit represents what the read/write/execute permissions would be in binary. Take a look:
\begin{verbatim}
0 = 000 = --- 
1 = 001 = --x
2 = 010 = -w-
3 = 011 = -wx
4 = 100 = r--
5 = 101 = r-x
6 = 110 = rw-
7 = 111 = rwx
\end{verbatim}
So, as a few examples,
\begin{verbatim}
777 = rwxrwxrwx
755 = rwxr-xr-x
132 = --x-wx-w-
564 = r-xrw-r--
000 = ---------
etc...
\end{verbatim}
So when we set our file junk1 to 755 earlier, we set it to rwxr-xr-x, which is a pretty good permission set on your average file. Realistically, you will usually always have your own user permissions set to rwx or rw-, otherwise you are just inconveniencing yourself. You can also use \texttt{chown} to change ownership of a file.

\section{Secure Shell (SSH)}
SSH gives you a secure, encrypted connection to a terminal session on a remote machine. It works exactly like a terminal session would on a local machine. 
\begin{verbatim}
ssh username@address
ssh address # The username of the machine you are connecting from will be used
\end{verbatim}
Where \texttt{username} is your username on the remote machine and \texttt{address} is the address of the machine to connect to. 

You can also use what is called `X forwarding' to run GUI applications on the remote machine, but have them display on the machine you are connecting from; you just use the -X or -Y switch.
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -X username@address
ssh -Y username@address # Trusted X Forwarding
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Secure Copy}
Secure copy uses SSH to transfer files from one machine to another. The syntax is relatively simple:
\begin{verbatim}
# Copy from remote machine to local machine
scp username@address:pathtosrcfile destonlocalmachine
# Copy from local machine to remote machine
scp fileonlocalmachine username@address:pathtodest
\end{verbatim}
Where \texttt{pathtosrcfile} and \texttt{pathtodest} are paths on the remote machine.

\subsection{SSH keys}
Public Key Cryptography\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography}} is used to protect what information is sent over SSH. There are two keys: a public key (to encrypt data) and a corresponding private key (to decrypt the encrypted data). Think of the public key as a padlock, and the private key as the key to open the padlock. 

With SSH, you store your public key on the computer you're connecting to, and keep your private key on the computer you want to connect from. When an SSH connection is initiated, the RSA\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)}} algorithm is used to check that the private key is correct for the public key, and if all is well you will be authenticated and given access.

All files pertaining to SSH can be found at \texttt{\textasciitilde/.ssh}. To generate a new SSH key, you run the command \texttt{ssh-keygen}:
\begin{verbatim}
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/cody/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/cody/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/cody/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
8c:09:0a:43:d5:b3:1e:28:e3:8d:d4:8c:84:4f:72:b0 cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|oo...            |
|+oo  o           |
|E=+ o o          |
| B.= + +         |
|o * . + S        |
| o . .           |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~$ cd ~/.ssh
cody@CODY-STUDIO-XPS:~/.ssh$ ls
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
\end{verbatim}
\emph{Note: This is obviously not output from generating my real private/public keys. This data is essentially useless to me}
If you decide to set a password, you will be prompted to enter that password to unlock your private key any time you want to connect via SSH.

\subsection{SSH tunnelling}
You can use what is known as SSH tunnelling, which is where you make all traffic pass through your SSH connection to protect your privacy and security, however that is beyond the scope of this guide.
